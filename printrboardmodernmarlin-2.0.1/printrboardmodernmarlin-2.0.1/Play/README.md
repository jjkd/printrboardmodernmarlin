<h1>Printrbot Play with Modern Marlin</h1>
<p>Here is a collection of the firmware that has been compiled for the Printrbot Play. To flash the firmware, follow the instructions on the <a href="https://reprap.org/wiki/Printrboard">Reprap Wiki</a>. If you have a standard Printrbot Play with a Rev F Printrboard, use the RevF_Play-NoLCD-v***.hex. If you have the heated bed upgrade, use the RevF_Play_HDB-NoLCD-v***.hex.<p>
<p><b>NOTE: On most of the versions (below version 0.7) the max Z feedrate is set to high which can cause the printer to stall. This can be fixed by simply running <code>M203 Z8</code> then <code>M500</code></b></p>
<p>Also, be sure to run <code>M502</code> then <code>M500</code> after flashing firmware.</p>
